# Laravel Ownership Package – Simplify Model Ownership in Laravel

Managing ownership relationships between models can get tricky in Laravel projects. The **[Laravel Ownership package](https://github.com/dibakarmitra/laravel-ownership)** by Dibakar Mitra makes it simple and elegant.

## 🚀 What is Laravel Ownership?
This package allows you to assign and manage ownership between different models. For example, a `User` can own a `Project`, `Team`, or any other entity. It uses a clean polymorphic approach without repeating boilerplate code.

## ✨ Features
- Polymorphic ownership handling out of the box.  
- Easy to integrate with existing models.  
- Supports roles for more advanced ownership structures.  
- Database migration included (`ownerships` table).  
- Works seamlessly with **Laravel 9, 10, and 11**.  

## 📦 Installation

1. Require the package:
   ```bash
   composer require dibakar/laravel-ownership
   ```

   *(if you’re testing the dev branch, use `composer require dibakar/laravel-ownership:dev-main`)*

2. Publish and run the migration:
   ```bash
   php artisan vendor:publish --tag=ownership-migrations
   php artisan migrate
   ```

3. Add the `HasOwnership` trait to your models:
   ```php
   use Dibakar\Ownership\Traits\HasOwnership;

   class Project extends Model
   {
       use HasOwnership;
   }
   ```

## 🔧 Usage Example
```php
$project = Project::find(1);
$user = User::find(1);

// Assign ownership
$project->assignOwner($user, 'manager');

// Check ownership
if ($project->isOwnedBy($user)) {
    echo "User owns this project!";
}
```

## 🤝 Why Use This Package?
- Keeps your code clean and DRY.  
- Avoids writing repetitive relationship logic.  
- Flexible enough to handle **teams, clients, vendors, or multi-role ownership**.
